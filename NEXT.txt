Can define backup method to individual folders/files. Incremental or archive.
If no method is chosen through add or config file, then defaults to a pre-set method in the config file. Selection on where to restore files, if user is doing distro-hopping or has changed usernames or environments.

TUI file explorer of backed up files, and methods to view, restore or delete from backup and other nice-to-have tui-tools for backup handling.
TUI selector for adding files to be backed up or unchecked from backup.
Can be the same interface with two or more roles for example.

Bump version when the TUI stuff is in place.

I want no limitations what types of files to be backed up, this isnt just for dotfiles, but its primarily usage is dotfiles and configurations.
